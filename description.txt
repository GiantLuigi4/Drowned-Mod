This is a mod that makes getting your own drowned world easier
|
It is a mod to flood your world.
Use Calamity Mod for the best experience and you MUST be on a large world.
|
You can change the flood type and disable the initial flood (for if your world was drowned with tEdit or something).
|
Add overhaul after drowned says done.
|
Now with universal world size support AND extra small/extra large world.
|
DO NOT MINE TOO FAST! THE GAME MIGHT DIE IF YOU DO!
|
Blue jellyfish will drop 3-5 gel while green, pink and blood drop 1-3
|
Changed gen to world gen so it's faster, but a bit quirkier... I can't figure out why.
|
It's generated during world gen proccesses thanks to:
